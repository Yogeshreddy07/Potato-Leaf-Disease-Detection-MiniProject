![Potato Leaf Disease Example](https://github.com/Yogeshreddy07/Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection-MiniProject/blob/main/dataset/image.jpg)

## Overview
This project aims to develop a **machine learning-based classification model** for detecting diseases in potato leaves, specifically **early blight** and **late blight**. By leveraging **deep learning and computer vision**, the system assists farmers in early disease diagnosis, enabling timely intervention and minimizing crop loss.

## Problem Statement
Potato diseases like early blight and late blight significantly impact crop yield. Traditional disease detection methods are time-consuming and require expert knowledge. This project introduces an **automated classification system** using deep learning to provide a quick and accurate diagnosis.

## Objectives
- Develop a **deep learning model** to classify potato leaves as **healthy or diseased**.
- Utilize **CNN-based architectures** to improve accuracy in image classification.
- Deploy the trained model using **Streamlit**, making it accessible for farmers.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Gather and preprocess images of healthy and diseased potato leaves.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Apply augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Selection & Training**: Train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classification.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model using **Streamlit**, allowing real-time image classification.

## Software & Hardware Requirements
### Hardware:
- **Processor**: Intel i5/Ryzen 5 or higher
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GTX 1060 or better (recommended for training)
- **RAM**: 16GB (32GB recommended)
- **Storage**: At least 100GB free SSD space

### Software:
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch
  - Streamlit
  - Pillow
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Development Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook / VS Code / PyCharm
  - Git for version control

## Results & Performance
- The trained model achieved **high accuracy** in distinguishing healthy vs. diseased leaves.
- The **Streamlit interface** allows users to upload leaf images and get real-time predictions.
  

## Future Work
- **Expand dataset** for better model generalization.
- **Improve model accuracy** with advanced architectures (e.g., EfficientNet, ViTs).
- **Deploy as a mobile app** using TensorFlow Lite.
- **Integrate weather and environmental data** to improve prediction reliability.
